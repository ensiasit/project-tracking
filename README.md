# Project Tracking

## What we gonna build?

We're building a project tracking application like [Trello](https://trello.com/).

The focus in the first part is going to be on the backend tier.

The type and the features of the application are chosen based on educational reasons.

## What we gonna cover?

We will try to cover a big majority of practices related to building cloud native applications.

- Build a REST API to cover all use cases
- Expose a Swagger UI for our API
- Secure our API (authentication + authorization)
- Write unit tests
- Set a CI/CD pipeline to package and deploy our application

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites apart from knowing basic Java.

We will cover quite a large set of technologies:

- Java (SE 11)
- Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate...
- JUnit 5
- Docker
- Github Actions

Every new introduced framework, tool or concept will be explained during the sessions.

## Sessions

Every session will be 60-90 minutes long.
